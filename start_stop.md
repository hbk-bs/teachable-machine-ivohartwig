# Teachable Machine Leraning 

Teachable Machine Learning is an approach to machine learning that allows users without programming skills to train their own models â€“ usually through a user-friendly interface like Google's Teachable Machine. For example, users can upload images, sounds, or poses to create an AI model that recognizes and classifies them. In short: Teachable Machine Learning makes it easy for anyone to create AI models by teaching the machine to recognize patterns from examples.
